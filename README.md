My 1st repository. Endless nights and determination and I WILL BE the worlds greatest web developer and hacker!

Hello world my name is Roona Nedgy Samson, my close friends and family call me Roona but to the rest of the world I'm know as Arena. I'm 20 years old and was born and raised in Caransie, Brooklyn, New York. My family is oringinally from the Carribbean Islands predominatelly Haiti and Cuba. God has blessed me with many talents, I sing and dance thus music being the love of my life. I also love to read and  write poetry, lyrics, and stories. I enjoy drawing, painting, and arts & crafts. During high school my dream was to attend Arts Academy University to study advertsing and graphic design, however now I currently reside in Georgia and attend Gwinnett Techical College where I major in Graphic Web-Design. I will soon tranfer to Savannah College of Art and Design (my second dream college) to further my eduction in Advertsing and Graphic Desgin. I've always been passionate about music and definitely want tp pursue a singing career but besides from my artisti and creative side, I'm also innovative and always looking for new ways to express and challenge myself mentally. Once I graduate with a Masters in both Advertsing and Graphic Desgin I want to one day be the CEO of my own advertising company.
